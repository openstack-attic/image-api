        <para>Glance may optionally be integrated with Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service
            project. Setting this up is relatively straightforward : the Keystone distribution at

            </itemizedlist> Once you have installed Keystone and edited your configuration files,
            newly created images will have their owner attribute set to the tenant of the
            authenticated users, and the <code>is_public</code> attribute will cause access to those
            images for which it is false to be restricted to only the owner.</para>
            
            <para>The exception is those images for which owner is set to null, which may only be
            done by those users having the Admin role. </para>
        <para>These images may still be accessed by the public, but will not appear in the list of
            public images. This allows the Glance Registry owner to publish images for beta testing
            without allowing those images to show up in lists, potentially confusing users.</para>
           <para>It is possible to allow a private image to be shared with one or more alternate
            tenants. This is done through image memberships, which are available via the members
            resource of images (For more details, see the chapter <link xlink:href="imagesapi.xml" xml:id="requesting-image-memberships">"Requesting Image Memberships"</link>).
            Essentially, a membership is an association between an image and a tenant which has
            permission to access that image. These membership associations may also have a
                <code>can_share</code>attribute, which, if set to true, delegates the authority to
            share an image to the named tenant.</para>
